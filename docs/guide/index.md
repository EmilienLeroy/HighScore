# Introduction

You can also get a leaderboard from highscore to display it into your games. 

## Motivation

Personnaly ([Emilien Leroy](https://github.com/EmilienLeroy)) I love make games, especial little mobile game.
But I hate create an account for each games I play or create. That's why I created Highscore.

arcard leaderboard.
