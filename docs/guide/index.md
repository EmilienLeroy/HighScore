## Motivation

Personnaly ([Emilien Leroy](https://github.com/EmilienLeroy)) I love make games, especial little mobile game.
But I hate create an account for each games I play or create. That's why I created Highscore.
A simple entry point to send my games scores easly without any authentification like an old
arcade leaderboard.

## Roadmap
